   <p>Basalt Architects won the C40 Reinventing Cities global competition for innovative carbon-free urban projects at Lágmúli in Reykjavik, Iceland. Lead designers for Fabric, they designed a communal, open building for a better future.</p>
    <p>Iceland´s capital city, Reykjavík, owes its very name to geothermal swells, exuding steam from the ground. The hidden powers beneath the site feed much of Reykjavík´s heating grid, yet this remarkable system is mostly hidden from sight, and therefore from mind. The project brings back to light this magnificent power by incorporating visual, tactile, hands-on features into the design of both site and building. This way, the project ensures that the city’s relationship with nature is brought thoroughly back to mind.
    
    The project in Reykjavík aims to create a hub for health, wellness, and sustainable lifestyles. The 14,500-square-meter building incentivizes alternative living and working, blending co-habitational housing, shared office space, public space, service, and retail. It demonstrates sustainability, inclusivity, and architectural rigor, with ventilation systems equipped for waste heat recovery and greenhouse energy reduction.
    
    The construction industry is reducing emissions by utilizing locally produced low-carbon materials like Icelandic stone wool, timber cladding, and cross-laminated timber, and diverting 95% of waste from landfills.
    
    The project focuses on biodiversity through the creation of green corridors, walls, roofs, greenhouses, and a thermal winter garden. A green ribbon extends the geothermal elements and showcases how modern use of natural resources can positively impact everyday life. It serves as a channel for geothermal technology and an incubator for green growth.
    
    Co-living is a growing trend in shared economy housing, offering affordable, communal solutions through innovative building techniques and private areas.
    
    The co-living concept promotes a simpler lifestyle with fewer possessions and more sharing, allowing residents to interact with plants and raise awareness of natural resources. This knowledge is passed on to future residents, spreading the idea beyond the residency.
    
    The co-living community focuses on local agriculture, allowing users to practice vertical farming and produce indoor food. The crops are used by local businesses for healthy meals and roof gardens offer recreational space.
    
    The public space south of the building is activated by the green axis that extends through the building and connects it to the geothermal park. Geothermal water is channeled from the existing borehole creating a variety of water features, including a footbath pool for users and passers by.

The plaza plays a very active role as a social space and gathering point for the users of the building as well as neighbours and other visitors. The pedestrian paths and connection points have been further elaborated. Both the use of the ground floor as a geothermal information center and the integration of a cafe/restaurant at ground level ensure the plaza is constantly active.</p>
